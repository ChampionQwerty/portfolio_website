        <p>The CompTIA Network+ certification is a globally recognized, vendor-neutral credential that validates foundational networking skills, 
            covering concepts like routing, security, troubleshooting, and infrastructure. This makes it ideal for entry-level IT professionals 
            seeking careers in networking or cybersecurity. I am currently using a website called TestOut to study for the test. To remember the information presented in 
            this course, I have taken to using a notebook and writing bullet points for everything. I plan on taking this certification test on May 27.
